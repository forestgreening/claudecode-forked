# oh-my-claudecode v4.10.0: HUD upgrades, LSP diagnostics, security hardening, and workflow polish

## Release Notes

Release 4.10.0 delivers a meaningful usability bump across the HUD, LSP integrations, security boundaries, and hook/runtime correctness. Highlights include configurable HUD layouts with worktree awareness, Kotlin LSP 3.17 pull diagnostics support, stronger worker/security enforcement, better setup reliability, and several fixes around persistent modes, skill state cleanup, and installed-build behavior.

- **feat(skill): add self-improve autonomous code improvement skill** — introduces a new builtin workflow for autonomous code improvement loops. (#2074)
- **fix(security): harden worker/tool boundaries and sandbox behavior** — tightens Python sandboxing, worker command constraints, and external LLM enforcement. (#2047, #2028, #2022, #2010, #2009, #2005)
- **fix(runtime): resolve persistent-mode, stop-hook, and installed-build edge cases** — improves session continuation safety, skill-state cleanup, CLAUDE config profile handling, and installed HUD fallback behavior. (#2104, #2088, #2086, #2066, #2050)
